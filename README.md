# About Meme Generator

This is my fifth project using React. It's main focus is to use [useState](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_usestate.asp) to track state in a function component and [useEffects](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_useeffect.asp) to perform side effects in your components.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
